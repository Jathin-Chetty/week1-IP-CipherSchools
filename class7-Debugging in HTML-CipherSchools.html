    <h2>paragraph</h2>
    <p>
        A paragraph is a group of related sentences that support one main idea. In general, paragraphs consist of three parts: the 
        topic sentence, body sentences, and the concluding or the bridge sentence to the next paragraph or section. 
        Paragraphs show where the subdivisions of a research paper begin and end and, thus, help the reader see the organization
         of the essay and grasp its main points.
