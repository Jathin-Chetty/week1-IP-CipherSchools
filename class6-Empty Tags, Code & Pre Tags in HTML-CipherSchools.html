    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both<br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
    And looked down one as far as I could<br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>

    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
    Though as for that the passing there<br>
    Had worn them really about the same,<br>

    <!-- line with break -->
    <p>
        And both that morning equally lay
        <hr>
        <!-- hr also works as a br -->
        In leaves no step had trodden black.

        'the starlight night' was
            one of two poems which hopkins 
            sent to his mother as a birthday present.

        the other poem being 'god's grandeur'
            what a birthday present!

        <code>(background-color: green)</code>
